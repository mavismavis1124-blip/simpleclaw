# SimpleClaw Naming Brainstorm

## Current: SimpleClaw
**Pros:** Clear, mentions the underlying tech (OpenClaw)
**Cons:** A bit generic, "Simple" is overused in SaaS

---

## Direction 1: Claw/Pincer Evolution
Keep the crustacean DNA but evolve it:

| Name | Vibe | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **ClawRun** | Action-oriented | "Run your bots with Claw" |
| **ClawHost** | Infrastructure | Clear hosting positioning |
| **Pincher** | Edgy, memorable | Pincher = crab/lobster claw, implies grab-and-go |
| **ShellOut** | Clever/dev humor | "Shell" + you shell out money, also shell = protection |
| **Crust** | Minimalist | Crustacean + infrastructure crust/core |

---

## Direction 2: Bot + Deployment Focus
What you actually do:

| Name | Vibe | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **BotBox** | Product | Like Mailbox, Dropbox — container vibes |
| **BotCell** | Biological | Cell = container, biological growth |
| **DeployBot** | Literal | Does exactly what it says |
| **RunBot** | Action | Focus on execution |
| **OneBot** | Singular | Matches your "1 bot" pricing |
| **SoloBot** | Independent | One bot, standing alone |

---

## Direction 3: Infrastructure/Runtime
Technical but sleek:

| Name | Vibe | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Runtime** | Premium | Your VM/runtime is the product |
| **PodBot** | K8s reference | Pod = container, modern infra |
| **Spin** | Action | Spin up a bot |
| **Droplet** | DO reference | Small, contained, drops into existence |
| **Instance** | AWS reference | One instance = one bot |

---

## Direction 4: Abstract/Brandable
Create new word, own it completely:

| Name | Vibe | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Sentinel** | Guardian | Bot that watches/responds |
| **Relay** | Connection | Passes messages through |
| **Tether** | Link | Connects Telegram to AI |
| **Proxy** | Technical | Bot as proxy to AI |
| **Conduit** | Pipeline | Message conduit |
| **Nexus** | Hub | Center of connection |

---

## Direction 5: Playful/Tech-Culture
| Name | Vibe | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| **BotButler** | Service | Your bot has a butler (you) |
| **BotMaid** | Service | Cleans up, maintains |
| **BotKeeper** | Care | Keeps your bot alive |
| **BotNanny** | Care | Watches over your bot |
| **BotHerder** | Rancher vibes | Herds your bot deployment |

### 3. **OneBot**

## Alternative: Keep Claw, Drop Simple
If you want to keep the OpenClaw connection:

- **ClawCloud** — "Your bots in the claw cloud"
- **ClawHub** — Central place for claw deployments
- **ClawBox** — Box/container metaphor
- **ClawShip** — Ship your bots

---

## What to Check Before Choosing
1. Domain availability (.dev, .io, .run)
2. Twitter/X handle availability
3. No trademark conflicts
4. Easy to pronounce over the phone
5. Passes the "bar test" (can you say it in a loud bar and someone understands?)
